.SH REMOTE CONTROL
.B pianobar
can be controlled through a fifo. You have to create it yourself by executing

 mkfifo ~/.config/pianobar/ctl

Adjust the path if you set up a $XDG_CONFIG_HOME. Afterwards you can write
commands directly into the fifo. Example (next song):

 echo -n 'n' > ~/.config/pianobar/ctl

.B n
is the keybinding for "next song". If you customized your keybindings you have to use these characters to control
.B pianobar.
.I This behaviour may change in the future!

Another example:

 while true; do;
    nc -l -p 12345 -s localhost localhost > ~/.config/pianobar/ctl;
    sleep 1;
 done

 echo -ne 'n\\x1a' | nc -q 0 127.0.0.1 12345

.SH EVENTCMD

.B pianobar
can report certain "events" to an external application (see
.B CONFIGURATION
). This application is started with the event name as it's first argument. More
information (artist, title, album, stationName, error code, error description,
song length in milliseconds, rating) is supplied through stdin.

Currently supported events are: artistbookmark, songban, songbookmark,
songexplain, songfinish, songlove, songmove, songshelf, songstart,
stationaddmusic, stationaddshared, stationcreate, stationdelete,
stationfetchplaylist, stationquickmixtoggle, stationrename

An example script can be found in the contrib/ directory of
.B pianobar's
source distribution.
