Install
=======

Dependencies
------------

gmake
libao				http://www.xiph.org/ao/
libfaad2			http://www.audiocoding.com/downloads.html
AND/OR libmad		http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/
pthreads
UTF-8 console/locale!

Building
--------

If you have all of the dependencies listed above just type

	gmake clean && gmake

NOTE: The above won't work on Mac OS X (Snow Leopard) since c99 targets i386
and cc (gcc4.2) targets x86_64. If you've built supporting libraries
(libao, etc.) using gcc, you'll be unable to link. You can work around
this issue by overriding CFLAGS[1]

	make clean && make CFLAGS="-O2 -DNDEBUG -W64"

You can run the client directly from the source directory now
 
	./pianobar

Or install it by issuing
	
	gmake install

In case you don't want to install libmad OR libfaad you probably want to
disable one of them:

	gmake clean && gmake DISABLE_FAAD=1

or

	gmake clean && gmake DISABLE_MAD=1

libpiano can be built and installed by running
	
	gmake clean && gmake libpiano && gmake install-libpiano
