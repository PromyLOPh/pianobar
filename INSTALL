Install
=======

Dependencies
------------

- gmake
- pthreads
- libao
- gnutls
- gcrypt
- json-c
- libfaad2 (compiled with --without-drm)
- libmad (optional, Pandora One users only)
- UTF-8 console/locale

Building
--------

If you have all of the dependencies listed above just type

	gmake clean && gmake

You can run the client directly from the source directory now
 
	./pianobar

Or install it by issuing
	
	gmake install

Selecting features
++++++++++++++++++

It is possible to disable certain features when building pianobar by setting
one of the variables listed below. In fact it is required if you don’t have the
corresponding library installed. So if you don’t want AAC playback or don’t
have libfaad installed for example, run

	gmake DISABLE_FAAD=1

instead of a plain `gmake`.

DISABLE_FAAD=1
	Disables AAC playback.
DISABLE_MAD=1
	Disables MP3 playback.

Mac OS X
++++++++

NOTE: The above won't work on Mac OS X (Snow Leopard) since c99 targets i386
and cc (gcc4.2) targets x86_64. If you've built supporting libraries
(libao, etc.) using gcc, you'll be unable to link. You can work around
this issue by overriding CFLAGS[1]

	make clean && make CFLAGS="-O2 -DNDEBUG -W64"

Ubuntu 12.04
++++++++++++

To install on Ubuntu >= 12.04

	sudo apt-get install \
			libao-dev \
			libmad0-dev \
			libfaad-dev \
			libgnutls-dev \
			libjson0-dev \
			libgcrypt11-dev
	make

You can then fire it up with `pianobar`
