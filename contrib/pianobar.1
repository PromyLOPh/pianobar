.SH REMOTE CONTROL
.B pianobar
can be controlled through a fifo. You have to create it yourself by executing

 mkfifo ~/.config/pianobar/ctl

Adjust the path if you set up a $XDG_CONFIG_HOME or changed the fifo setting.
Afterwards you can write commands directly into the fifo. Example (next song):

 echo -n 'n' > ~/.config/pianobar/ctl

.B n
is the keybinding for "next song". If you customized your keybindings you have to use these characters to control
.B pianobar.
.I This behaviour may change in the future!

Another example:

 while true; do;
    nc -l -p 12345 -s localhost localhost > ~/.config/pianobar/ctl;
    sleep 1;
 done

 echo -ne 'n\\x1a' | nc -q 0 127.0.0.1 12345

.SH EVENTCMD

.B pianobar
can report certain "events" to an external application (see
.B CONFIGURATION
). This application is started with the event name as it's first argument. More
information like error code and description, was well as song information
related to the current event, is supplied through stdin.

Currently supported events are: artistbookmark, songban, songbookmark,
songexplain, songfinish, songlove, songmove, songshelf, songstart,
stationaddgenre, stationaddmusic, stationaddshared, stationcreate,
stationdelete, stationdeleteartistseed, stationdeletefeedback,
stationdeletesongseed, stationfetchinfo, stationfetchplaylist,
stationfetchgenre stationquickmixtoggle, stationrename, userlogin,
usergetstations

An example script can be found in the contrib/ directory of
.B pianobar's
source distribution.
