### Description/instructions:
#
# This script to allow pianobar to run headlessly as well as re-connect to
# pianobar's UI.
#
# When this script is launched, if pianobar isn't running, it will launch
# pianobar (in the background) and then immediately connect to pianobar's UI to
# allow the user to do things such as log in.  If pianobar is running, this
# script will simply connect to pianobar's UI.
#
# If you close this script with ctrl-c or by closing the terminal, pianobar
# should continue running in the background.
#
# To close pianobar, press the key mapped to close pianobar ('q' by default).
# This script should detect that pianobar died and close as well.
#
### Known issues/limitations:
#
# When the user is at a text input field - such as login or naming a station -
# mappings to quit pianobar ('q' by default) will not quit pianobar.  Moreover,
# techniques such as ctrl-c or closing the terminal will not quit pianobar
# either, as they only quit this script and leave pianobar running headlessly.
# To quit pianobar from this situation, one must either complete the text entry
# and get pianobar to a state where it will accept the quit mapping, or one
# must kill pianobar from outside of this script through commands such as
# `kill`.
#
# This script was initially intended to be bourne-shell compatible and
# portable, however one major limitation was found: the bourne shell does not
# seem to have a good way to read a single character at a time such as can be
# done with bash's "-n" flag.  Thus this script is dependent on less portable
# techniques and currently requires bash.


# This script regularly checks whether or not pianobar is running in the
# background in order to detect when it closes.  This variable sets how long of
# a delay there will be between checks (in seconds).
CHECK_PERIOD=${CHECK_PERIOD:-"1"}

# This variable will set how many lines of pianobar's output to print when
# re-connecting to pianobar.
OUTPUT_LINES=${OUTPUT_LINES:-"30"}
